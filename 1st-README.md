# AUR-cloudcompare
I have no idea what I am doing, but I know that the git version of CloudCompare does not install / operate on my Manjaro KDE version of OS.
I have sought ways to help myself and I have asked for assistance in several ways, but I suspect they are not correct.

It seems reasonable to me to leave this "readme" here in the hopes that someone else with more knowledge might be able to help, or at least point
me to how this process should happen.

Thank you in advance jim@groundscouts.com
